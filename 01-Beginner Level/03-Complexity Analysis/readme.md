# Complexity Analysis

## Big O notation

**Definition:** Big O notation is used to describe the upper bound of the growth rate of an algorithm's time or space complexity in the worst-case scenario.

**Purpose:** It helps in understanding how the time or space required by an algorithm increases as the size of the input grows.

**Example:** If an algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2), it means that the time taken by the algorithm grows quadratically as the input size (n) increases.

## Time and Space Complexity analysis

**Time Complexity:** It measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of its input.

**Example:** An algorithm with linear time complexity (O(n)) takes time proportional to the size of the input.

**Space Complexity:** It measures the amount of memory space an algorithm takes as a function of the length of its input.

**Example:** An algorithm with constant space complexity (O(1)) uses a fixed amount of memory regardless of the input size.

## Importance

- **Efficiency:** Complexity analysis helps in identifying the most efficient algorithm for solving a problem.
- **Scalability:** It provides insights into how an algorithm performs as the size of the input data increases.
- **Optimization:** Understanding the complexity of algorithms is essential for optimizing code and improving performance.

## Examples

- **Linear Search:** Time complexity - O(n), Space complexity - O(1)
- **Binary Search:** Time complexity - O(log n), Space complexity - O(1)
- **Bubble Sort:** Time complexity - O(n^2), Space complexity - O(1)
- **Merge Sort:** Time complexity - O(n log n), Space complexity - O(n)
